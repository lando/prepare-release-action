# Prepare Release Action

This action allows you to automate release steps eg bump version, compile code, bundle deps and optionally push/sync those changes back to the soruce repo.

It was designed for Lando Plugin and has an easy-mode `lando-plugin` input, however, you should be able to use it on any javascript project.

## Inputs

All inputs are optional however if you are **NOT** triggering this action on a `release` then you will need to set `version`.

| Name | Description | Default | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `version` | The version of the thing to be released. Must be a semver valid string. | `${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}` | `v3.14.0` |
| `bundle-dependencies` | A toggle to autoset `bundleDependencies` in `package.json`. | `false` | `true` |
| `commands` | A list of commands to run to prepare the release. | `[]` | `npm run prepare` |
| `root` | The location of the code being prepared for release. | `${{ github.workspace }}` | `/path/to/my/project` |
| `sync` | A toggle to enable/disable code syncing. | `true` | `false` |
| `sync-branch` | The target branch to use when syncing changes back to the repo. | `${{ github.event.release.target_commitish \|\| github.event.pull_request.head.ref \|\| github.ref_name }}` | `main` |
| `sync-email` | The email to use when syncing changes back to the repo. | `github-actions@github.com` | `riker@starfleet.gov` |
| `sync-message` | The commit message to use when syncing changes back to the repo. | `release v%s generated by @lando/prepare-release-action` | `RELEASE %s` |
| `sync-tags` | A list of other tags to sync back to the repo. | `[]` | `v2` |
| `sync-username` | The username to use when syncing changes back to the repo. | `github-actions` | `w.t.riker` |
| `version-match` | A regex to help find the latest tag. Only used when `version=dev`. | `v[0-9].*` | `[1-2].*` |
| `lando-plugin` | A special easy-mode setting to prepare and valdiate Lando plugins. | `false` | `true` |

Note that `sync` must be set to `true` for the other `sync-*` options to do anything. Also note that in `sync-message` you can use `%s` as a placeholder for the version.

Also note that `bundle-dependencies` runs _after_ sync eg it will not push changes to `bundleDependencies` in your `package.json` back to your repo.

## Caveats

* If your project is a shallow clone (as is the default for `@actions/checkout`) we will `--unshallow` it to a full clone in order to sync changes.
* If you have [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) or [tag protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-tag-protection-rules) turned on you will need to make sure your rules allow the `sync-user` to both write to the `sync-branch` and to allow a `--force` alteration of the repos tags.
